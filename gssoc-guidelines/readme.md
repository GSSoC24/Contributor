## Introduction

We've noticed a rise in the number of cases where contributors gain high points for submissions that are not actual contributions.

Every contributor should remember one thing: Labels on PRs are a must have `gssoc`, `level1` or `level2` or `level3`.
- `level1`: 10 points
- `level2`: 25 points
- `level3`: 45 points

If you reach the top of the leaderboard with small code snippets, repeated copy-paste PRs, or spam PRs, you will be temporarily banned until we perform manual checks on suspicious contributions and reduce score on leaderboard.

---

## Important Points for Contributors

- **Meaningful Contributions**: Build your GitHub profile with meaningful badges and PRs.
- **Manual Verification**: Our team will verify most of your PR, espescially people on the top of leaderboard.
- **Avoid Spam**: Do not submit spam PRs or address similar issues repeatedly.
- **GitHub Profile**: If all of your contributions are meaningful to the projects, we have the potential to increase perks and opportunities including from the existing project admins. 

---

## Meaningful Contribution Guidelines

- Beginners can contribute to README files, workflows, or documentation.
- PRs for README, workflow, or documentation will be evaluated and potentially upgraded based on completeness.
- Do not create multiple document change issues. Inform the contributor who worked on the documentation for future updates.
- Follow a first-come, first-served approach for issues.
- Participate in only one role: PA, Mentor, or Contributor.
- Inactive projects for more than 2 weeks will be removed.

---

## Instructions for Mentors and Project Admins (PAs)

- **Fair Issue Assignment**: Follow a first-come, first-served approach.
- **Avoid Partiality**: Ensure fair assignment of issues, dont let PR without raising issues.
- **Single Role Participation**: PAs and Mentors should not contribute to the same projects to avoid conflict of interest.
- **Inactive Projects**: Projects inactive for more than 2 weeks will be removed.

---

## Report issues to us

- **Minimal Changes**: PRs with minimal changes that are not impactful and getting level 2 and level 3.
- **Multiple Roles**: Contributors acting as PAs or Mentors.
- **Instant PR Acceptance**: PRs accepted instantly without proper review.

### Report Suspicious Activity

- **Raise Discussion for it with PR links**: https://github.com/GSSoC24/Contributor/discussions/categories/q-a

### Non-Considerable PRs

- Multiple documentation or workflow issues.
- Exploiting personal connections with PAs or Mentors.
- Repeated documentation or workflow contributions beyond 200 points.
- Code snippets or template-related PRs.

## HOW TO DETECT SPAMS AND FAKE CONTRIBUTIONS 

## An example of this can be - üî¢

1. Gaining high rep points for submission such as changing -> README.MD to README.md and getting levels for it.

2. Contributing to the same project but each PR is having very minimal changes. This could either be changing a line of code (without actually being Impactful) or changes that are not necessary in the first place. This doesn't have to be strictly in any one project or code, line except for a typo.
   ![image](https://github.com/GSSoC24/Contributor/assets/30715153/1b11fdcd-6119-4f73-8faa-256883359bea)

3. Contributors are being PA as well for some projects. This is where contributors ask PA to give high levels for very basic changes which is not actually right.

4. PA favoring one contributor - This includes assigning level3 for most of the PR, merging PR without review, and no respective issue.

5. Raising multiple Workflow issue like this, contributor can raise one single and issue or PR and get all workflows done in level 2. Gettting levels for individual PR for Workflow is not allowed.

6. Getting level3 for fixing bugs, for example the below is the deployment created in previous with level3, not the same user is getting fixing bug in deploymnet level3 again, max you can provide is level1 if code changes is less no levels should be provided.

7. Working beyond the repository. Example, Raising a PR on repo and getting level3 or 2 and mention the work done in different repo like server creation etc.
   All the work should be attached and explained in the Pr if it beyond any other repo.

8. We mentioned PAs not to give more than 150 points for below mentioned projects as they are spamming if more than 150 points found in such repo by single contributor level comes down.

more list will be added when we find it out.
This limit is for the doucmentation updates, adding library folders , adding muliple projects to the website (kinda advanced version on library adding to repos, any technical functionality can be added above 150 points in these repos.

### Why are we doing this? - üëç

This is being done keeping everyone in mind for being hardworking enough to contribute something meaningful even if it's something small. We are doing this to make this event fair and memorable for all.
- Right now we noticed spamming could have happened due to a lack of written guidelines, so for those who people did it, we will be allowing 200 points to gain from merging PR with official Emails and remove other scores.
- Those who do spam after publishing the guidelines, if we notice we will further level down without any notice. 
### How to detect them - üíØ

1. If you find anyone pushing PR with changing a single change which are not necessary in a same project and gaining high reps for it. Kindly let us know. [report here](https://github.com/GSSoC24/Contributor/discussions/categories/q-a)
2. If any PA is also accepting PR from any contributor which shouldn't be accepted in the first place or giving high reps or assigning labels that should not be given, [kindly let us know](https://github.com/GSSoC24/Contributor/discussions/categories/q-a)
4. Anyone who suspects someone who is contributing at a particular time and his/her PR instantly is getting accepted regardless of being an actual contribution, kindly let us know [report here](https://github.com/GSSoC24/Contributor/discussions/categories/q-a)
5. If anyone suspects that PA is the contributor itself or vice versa, kindly let us know @sanjay-kv
6. Even if you find anyone suspicious kindly let us know . Mail us gssoc@girlscript.tech

### Spam PRs or PRs Won't consider:
1. If you create multiple Issues on documentation or workflow. Your PRs won't be considered.
2. If you know the PA or mentor. If you take advantage of it to make more PRs. Your PRs won't be considered.
3. If you completely depend on documentation or workflow or GitHub bots, Only the first 150 points will be considered. Focus on a variety of contributions.
4. If you create a code snippet PR for example a PR for issue template, a PR for PR temple, etc. Your PRs won't be considered. 
5. Contributors, you are free to create any number of PRs in any repos excluding few repo listed below. Sticking to a particular repo will give you a strong command of the project and the tech stack. However, if we see you spamming PRs or issues, severe action will be taken against you.
