# Contribution Guidelines

We value the quality of contributions to our open source projects and want to maintain a fair and productive environment for all contributors. To ensure this, we have established some guidelines to prevent spamming and misuse of our scoring system.

## Important Notice

**Contributors should not be awarded more than 150 points for contributions to the following repositories:**

[`machine-learning-repos`](https://github.com/Recode-Hive/machine-learning-repos) 
[`GGExtensions`](https://github.com/Sulagna-Dutta-Roy/GGExtensions) 
[`GameZone`](https://github.com/kunjgit/GameZone) 
[`codeharborhub.github.io`](https://github.com/CodeHarborHub/codeharborhub.github.io) 
[`ResourceHub`](https://github.com/jfmartinz/ResourceHub) 
[`HelpOps-Hub`](https://github.com/mdazfar2/HelpOps-Hub) 
[`BloxAI`](https://github.com/subhadeeproy3902/BloxAI) 
(More repositories will be added as identified)

## Detailed Guidelines

### Point Limit

- A single contributor can earn a maximum of 150 points for contributions to the repositories listed above.
- Contributions exceeding 150 points in these repositories will result in a reduction of the contributor's level.

### Contribution Quality

- Contributions should be meaningful and add value to the project.
- Simple additions, such as downloading a Python file from ChatGPT and uploading it, do not qualify as valuable contributions.

### Repository Structure

- Avoid creating a folder structure where different programs are added to sub-folders unless it significantly improves the project.
- Contributions should not be purely structural or organizational without substantial code changes or enhancements.

### Misuse Prevention

- We have noticed some contributors misusing the system to climb the leaderboard. Such activities are discouraged and will be monitored.
- Contributors found spamming or adding low-quality contributions will have their points reviewed and potentially reduced.

### Reporting Issues

- If you observe any contributor misusing the system, please report it via comments or other provided reporting mechanisms.
- All feedback on potential misuse is appreciated and will be investigated thoroughly.

### Legitimate Contributions

- Contributions involving significant code changes, deployment, technical issue resolution, or feature additions will be considered for higher levels.
- Ensure that your contributions are in line with the project's goals and add real value to the open source community.

## Examples of Quality Contributions

- Creating a deployment script that automates the project setup.
- Adding a search feature that enhances the functionality of the repository.
- Resolving technical issues that improve the overall stability and performance of the project.

## Conclusion

These guidelines aim to maintain the integrity and quality of our open source projects. We encourage everyone to contribute meaningfully and help us create a productive and fair environment for all contributors.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.
