# Contribution Guidelines

If you reach the top of the leaderboard with small code snippets, repeated copy-paste PRs, or spam PRs, you will only be at the top temporarily as we do manual checks on suspicious contributions. We do manual checks on the leaderboard for most of the leaderboard contributions. This is because we promised to give Job Fair and other perks to genuine contributors which include web3 conf tickets as well. Additionally, we assured our partner companies that we would recommend good and skilled contributors.

Therefore, we remove all spam and unnecessary PRs. During this process, our team will verify all your PRs. Do not repeatedly address similar issues. You need to build your GitHub profile with meaningful badges and PRs. In the future, if you apply to any company, they will primarily check your GitHub profile. If they see your badges, they will get a good impression of you and ideally they will check your merged PRs. They will only consider you if they are meaningful. If you have spam PRs, they won't consider you.

If all of your contributions are meaningful to the projects, we have the potential to increase perks and opportunities including from the existing project admins. We are adding a few rules to reduce spam PRs. We have defined meaningful PRs below. Please follow them.

## Instructions for Everyone (Mentors, Project Admins, Contributors)

### Note: Meaningful contribution means

1. **Beginners and Documentation Contributions:**
   - If you are a beginner or lack experience with README files, workflows, or documentation, you can contribute to those types of issues.
   
2. **PR Responsibilities:**
   - If you create a PR for a README, workflow, or document-related issue, it is your responsibility to make future PRs on the README or workflow for free, with no level or GSSoC label. Currently, we assign level 1 to these types of issues. If you contribute without a label, we will evaluate the changes and potentially upgrade your PR to level 2 or level 3 based on the completeness of the README, workflow, or document changes.

3. **Document Change Issues:**
   - PAs or Mentors, please don't create multiple document change issues. Instead, inform the contributor who worked on the documentation if possible.

4. **Issue Assignment:**
   - PAs or Mentors, please follow a first-come, first-served approach. We found that some repos assign issues with partiality. If an issue is created by someone, ask the creator, "Do you want to work on it or is it open to all?" If they want to work on it, assign it to them; if not, make it an open issue and assign it on a first-come, first-served basis.

5. **Role Participation:**
   - Everyone, please ensure you can participate in only one role as a PA, Mentor, or Contributor. Not multiple roles. If we find someone with multiple roles, severe action will be taken because we have mentioned this point from the beginning of the program.

6. **Inactive Repos:**
   - PAs or Mentors, if any repo is inactive for more than 2 weeks, we will remove that project.

7. **Meaningful Coding Contributions:**
   - Contributors, make sure that if you are a coder, you contribute to meaningful coding issues, spamming won't help in any way, and we have a strict team this time to check it this year.

8. **Issue Duplication:**
   - Contributors, before raising an issue, please check if it has already been raised. If it has not been raised, then create the issue.

9. **GitHub Repo-related PRs:**
   - All GitHub repo-related PRs won't be recreated. GitHub repo-related PRs include documentation, bots, workflows, templates, etc. If you are assigned one issue related to this point, then you have complete responsibility for that issue in the future. You need to create unlabelled PRs for those future updates. Opensource is not just about the leaderboard and points.

10. **README Updates:**
    - Contributors, if your code change may affect the repo's functionality but the code is important, then update the README in your PR.

11. **Migration Code:**
    - If you are working on migration code, create PRs and issues based on the difficulty of the complete migration work. Discuss with mentors or PAs and create the issue accordingly.
